# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2019-11 calendar

This is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1192638034736340994)

Notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm assuming the New Heroes banner on 2019-11-19 will be released with Paralogue 40 and the New Heroes banner on 2019-12-06 will start Book IV.
    
*   I'm guessing version 4.0.0 will be released on 2019-12-04 (two days before a New Heroes banner), but if we follow the last two months that might actually happen (very) close to (or even after) the 2019-12-05 reset.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2019-12-06. The list below ends on 2019-12-09 to finish the Arena week.
    

Expect some errors from bugs, reward changes by IS, unlisted events, wrong predictions, etc

I'll try to update this as datamines come out, but I might give up on the last few days since it involves too much futurology. We'll see.

Last updated 2019-12-05:

*   On 2019-11-19 we're getting Xenologue 5 with 9 orbs, but no new Chain Challenge or Lunatic Quests
    
*   On 2019-12-03 the Astra Blessing quests will give out 5 orbs
    
*   We're still not sure what we'll get on 2019-12-06, so manually list orb counts for new chapter(s) and new paralogue
    
*   Book IV begins on 2019-12-06 with a special log-in bonus. They didn't mention chapter 2, but let's assume it'll be the same as Book II and III.
    
*   Add Axe Arts quests on 2019-12-07
