# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2022-01 calendar

Hello, hello Reddit. Happy New Year everyone, let's make this a great one.

Anyway, as always make sure to thank my proofreader [/u/Unexpected\_Miso](/u/Unexpected_Miso/) as well as [/u/tgdm](/u/tgdm/) for creating a calendar maker for me to use.

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1480736245680644102).

Notes:

*   The official calendar is in PST (UTC-8), which means that for most of the world the events will appear to start one day later. (Except for Grand Conquests and Røkkr Sieges, which start 4 hours after the reset and so already "look right")
    
*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. I'm also assuming you'll get 2 orbs at the end of each round of Pawns of Loki for your tier. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   Oddly enough the calendar is missing a Tempest Trials+ Log-In Bonus for the Valentine's banner. We won't be factoring that in until we know for sure if there is one or not.
    
*   Previous "Flying Strike Quests" gave 0 orbs, so I'm assuming we'll also get 0 orbs on 2022-01-14. Previous "Three Heroes Quests" gave 6 orbs, so I'm assuming we'll also get 6 orbs on 2022-02-03.
    
*   I'm guessing version 6.2.0 with Squad Assault 55 will be released on 2022-02-06, 2 days before the Special Heroes banner.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2022-02-09. The list below ends on 2022-02-14 to finish the Arena week.
