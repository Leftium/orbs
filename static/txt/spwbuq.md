# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2022-02 calendar

Happy 5th Anniversary for FEH everyone. Hopefully, I won't have to make a bunch of edits to this estimate like last month. Anyway, as always make sure to thank my proofreader [/u/Unexpected\_Miso](/u/Unexpected_Miso/) as well as [/u/tgdm](/u/tgdm/) for creating a calendar maker for me to use.

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1491970271900753920).

Notes:

*   The official calendar is in PST (UTC-8), which means that for most of the world the events will appear to start one day later. (Except for Grand Conquests and Røkkr Sieges, which start 4 hours after the reset and so already "look right")
    
*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. I'm also assuming you'll get 2 orbs at the end of each round of Pawns of Loki for your tier. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 6.3.0 with Squad Assault 56 will be released on 2022-03-06, 2 days before the Special Heroes banner.
    
*   Previous Blue Battle Quests and Test of an Axe/a Lance Quests gave 4 orbs so I'm assuming we'll also get 4 orbs on 2022-02-20 and 2022-02-27.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2022-03-10. The list below ends on 2022-03-14 to finish the Arena week.
