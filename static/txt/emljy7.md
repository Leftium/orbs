# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2020-01 calendar

This is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1215468302107058176).

Notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 4.2.0 with Squad Assault 31 will be released on 2020-02-05 (two days before a Special Heroes banner)
    
*   At least for now I'm going to assume the New Heroes banner on 2020-01-20 will be released with Paralogue 42 instead of Book IV, Chapter 4.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2020-02-08. The list below ends on 2020-02-10 to complete the Arena week.
    

Expect some errors from bugs, reward changes by IS, unlisted events, wrong predictions, etc
