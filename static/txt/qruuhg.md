# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2021-11 calendar

Hello, hello Reddit. Everyone used to daylight savings yet? I know I haven't. First off, I'd like to introduce my proofreader [/u/Unexpected\_Miso](/u/Unexpected_Miso/) as well as [/u/tgdm](/u/tgdm/) for creating a calendar maker for me to use. Make sure to thank both of these people in the comments.

This list of orbs is based on the most [recent calendar.](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1458630587871289345)

Notes:

*   The official calendar is in PST (UTC-8), which means that for most of the world the events will appear to start one day later. (Except for Grand Conquests and Røkkr Sieges, which start 4 hours after the reset and so already "look right")
    
*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. I'm also assuming you'll get 2 orbs at the end of each round of Pawns of Loki for your tier. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   Previous "Coliseum & Ordeals Quests" gave 4 orbs, so I'm assuming we'll also get 4 orbs on 2021-12-02.
    
*   I'm guessing version 6.0.0 with Squad Assault 53 will be released on 2021-12-05, 2 days before the New Heroes banner.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2021-12-09. The list below ends on 2020-12-13 to finish the Arena week.
