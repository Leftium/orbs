# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2020-06 calendar

[](https://i.imgur.com/k59MHYd.png)

Late post, as expected - I've been sick.

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/img/topics/detail/img_20200611.png)

Notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing vVersion 4.7.0 with Squad Assault 36 will be was released on 2020-07-052020-07-06 (two days before a Special Heroes banner).
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2020-07-10. The list below ends on 2020-07-13 to complete the Arena week.
    
*   Previous "$MOVE\_TYPE Mastery" quests distributed 4 orbs. I'm assuming that'll also be the case for the Armored Mastery quests on 2020-07-04.

Updates:

*   2020-06-18:
    
    *   2 orbs per day for 7 days for Call of the Sea special stages starting on 2020-06-18
        
    *   1 orb for RB / AA quests on 2020-06-23. Will we get this every 2 weeks now?
        
*   2020-06-18 second edit:
    
    *   yes, AA will start alternating with RB. I'm assuming the new RB / AA quests will give out 1 orb every 2 weeks starting on 2020-06-23. This moves the AB orbs from 2020-06-29 to 2020-07-06 and adds 1 RB orb on 2020-06-23 and 2020-07-07
        
    *   For the first time ever we're not getting a 2-week interval between Grandmaster stages - Grandmaster 59 will appear 3 weeks after Grandmaster 58. Assume (hah!) this is a one-off and move Grandmaster 60 (and its presumed orb) from 2020-07-02 to 2020-07-09.
        
*   2020-06-30:
    
    *   confirm the 10 orbs for Feh's Quiz Event on 2020-06-30
        
    *   confirm the 4 orbs for Armored Mastery quests on 2020-07-04
        
    *   1 orb for RB / AB / AA quests on 2020-06-30. Will we get RB every week from now on, or only until 4.7.0 is released and the issue claiming rewards is fixed? Edit: looks like it's weekly.
        
*   2020-07-06:
    
    *   move the orbs for Squad Assault 36 from 2020-07-06 to 2020-07-05.
        
    *   remove the (unconfirmed) orb for Grandmaster 60 from 2020-07-09. It's now confirmed to come on 2020-07-16.
