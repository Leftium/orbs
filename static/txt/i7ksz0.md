# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2020-08 calendar

[](https://i.imgur.com/k59MHYd.png)

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/img/topics/detail/img_20200811.png).

Notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   The list assumes CYL4 will come with a new paralogue. My personal guess is that it'll be a new main story chapter for the first time, but let's keep this list conservative. We'll get more orbs on Aug 18 and Sep 8 if we get a new main story chapter.
    
*   I'm guessing version 4.9.0 with Squad Assault 38 will be released on 2020-09-06, two days before a Special Heroes banner.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2020-09-10. The list below ends on 2020-09-14 to complete the Arena week.
    
*   We've never seen "Coliseum & Ordeals Quests" before. Previous "Coliseum Quests" distributed 4 orbs, so I'm guessing that's what we'll get on 2020-09-07.

Edit:

*   2020-08-11:
    
    *   15 extra orbs on 2020-08-11 as compensation for the Hero Fest issue.
        
    *   Change CYL4 to a new paralogue instead of main story chapter, to err on the conservative side. This reduces the number of orbs on 2020-08-18 and 2020-09-08
        
*   2020-08-15:
    
    *   Change CYL4 back to a new main story chapter. This gives us 8 more orbs on 2020-08-18 and 8 more on 2020-09-08
        
*   2020-08-31:
    
    *   Confirm the 4 orbs for Coliseum & Ordeals Quests on 2020-09-07
