# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2021-10 calendar

Oh god, I'm still here. Once again, please tell me if I make a mistake since I'm still new at this. Especially with daylight savings.

Oh, and here's a question for the community. How many of you can consistently get 3 orbs from tier rewards in Pawns of Loki? I feel like that's a pretty easy thing to do now, especially with the new tier for hardcore players.

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar.](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1447396631301742592)

Notes:

*   Thank you [/u/RobertPao25](/u/RobertPao25/) for the corrections.
    
*   Daylight savings ends on Nov 7th, so the only day it should be affecting is the last item on the calendar, which is the Forging bonds Revival. Which should be occurring on the 8th for non-PST.
    
*   There's a discrepancy in when Grand Hero Revival - Veld: Manfroy's Rock will occur between the JP calendar and the Eng calendar. This should not be a result of daylight savings as that occurs on the 7th. So, I'll be going with the JP calendar until some update happens.
    
*   The orbs for an event are shown either on the first day of the event or, if the event has multiple rounds, on the first day of each round. That doesn't mean it's possible to get all orbs on those exact days.
    
*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. I'm also assuming you'll get 2 orbs at the end of each round of Pawns of Loki for your tier. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 5.11.0 with Squad Assault 52 will be released on 2021-11-03, 2 days before a Special Heroes banner.
    
*   I'm assuming that the Test of an Axe Quest will have similar rewards to the [Test of a Lance Quests](https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Quests_and_Missions_archive/July_2021#Test_of_a_Lance)
