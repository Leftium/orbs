# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2022-05 calendar

Hello FEH subreddit, hey it's my birthday this month. Anyway, as always make sure to thank my proofreader [/u/Unexpected\_Miso](/u/Unexpected_Miso/) as well as [/u/tgdm](/u/tgdm/) for creating a calendar maker for me to use.

This list of orbs is based on the most recent calendar.

Notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. I'm also assuming you'll get 2 orbs at the end of each round of Pawns of Loki for your tier. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 6.6.0 with Squad Assault 59 will be released on 2022-06-06, 2 days before the New Heroes banner.
    
*   Previous (Movement Type) Clash Quests gave no orbs, so I'm assuming we'll also get no orbs on 2022-05-21.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2022-06-10. The list below ends on 2022-06-13 to finish the Arena week.
