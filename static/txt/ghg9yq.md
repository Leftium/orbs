# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2020-05 calendar

[](https://i.imgur.com/k59MHYd.png)

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1259679622809161735).

Notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 4.6.0 with Squad Assault 35 will be released on 2020-06-03 (two days before a New Heroes banner) 2020-06-04 during the scheduled maintenance.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2020-06-10. The list below ends on 2020-06-15 to complete the Arena week, even though that looks really bare right now.
    
*   Previous "$WEAPON Arts Quests" and "Coliseum Quests" distributed 4 orbs each. I'm going to wait until the data update before updating the list below, but it's likely we'll get 4 more orbs on 2020-05-21 and 2020-06-04.

Edit:

*   2020-05-20:
    
    *   4 orbs for Tome Arts Quests on 2020-05-21, as expected
        
*   2020-05-25:
    
    *   move the orb for the (still unconfirmed) Skill Studies 84 from 2020-05-28 to 2020-05-29 since it wasn't added in the last data update. Maybe it'll be about the new mythic hero?
        
    *   add 4 unconfirmed orbs for Coliseum Quests on 2020-06-04 since that's what previous Coliseum Quests distributed.
        
*   2020-06-02:
    
    *   confirm the 4 orbs for Coliseum quests on 2020-06-02
        
    *   move the orb Squad Assault 35 to 2020-06-04, though maybe that should've gone to 2020-06-05 since the maintenance is scheduled to run until the reset.
        
*   2020-06-14:
    
    *   confirm Skill Studies 84 on 2020-05-29
        
    *   5 apology orbs on 2020-06-05 for the TT/FB issue when you used the new suspend feature in AA
        
    *   Røkkr Sieges starting on 2020-06-12, leading to 6 more orbs on the 12th and on the 14th.
