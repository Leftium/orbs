# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2020-10 calendar

[](https://i.imgur.com/k59MHYd.png)

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1314400262958743553/photo/1).

Notes:

*   DST in the USA ends on 2020-11-01, but the whole calendar is already in PST (UTC-8), so the start dates there are off by 1 for most of the world. The dates below are in, let's say, UTC-7, so the reset always happens at midnight.
    
*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 4.11.0 with Squad Assault 40 will be released on 2020-11-04, 2 days before a Special Heroes banner.
    
*   I'm guessing Grandmaster 66 with 1 orb will be released on 2020-11-05, but they haven't been completely consistent lately.
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2020-11-10. The list below ends on 2020-11-16 to complete the Arena week.
    
*   We've never seen "Clear Quests" or "Red Battle Quests". We frequently get 4 orbs from these random quests, but I'm just going to wait to see how many we get.
    
*   Don't get fooled by the total number of orbs - this time we're including a particularly large number of days and 2 Tempest Trials.
    
*   [Looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/jo9672/datamine_grab_bag_20201105/gb7839k/) Pawns of Loki will distribute up to 6 orbs for your cumulative score, up to 3 for your tier and 1 orb per round via quests (and then there're the extra orbs for the release celebration). For now I'm going to assume 2 orbs for your tier.
