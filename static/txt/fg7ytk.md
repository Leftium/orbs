# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2020-03 calendar

[](https://i.imgur.com/k59MHYd.png)

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1237211575402070016).

The usual notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 4.4.0 with Squad Assault 33 will be released on 2020-04-06 (two days before a New Heroes banner)
    
*   The calendar has events up to 2020-04-10. The list below ends on 2020-04-13 to complete the Arena week.
