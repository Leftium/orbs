# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2019-10 calendar

This is based on the [most recent calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_EN/status/1182491008166174720).

Notes:

*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly
    
*   I'm assuming that both New Heroes events on 2019-10-21 and 2019-11-07 will be regular new heroes, with 5 story chapters. We'll get less orbs if one of those is the Farfetched banner
    
*   DST in the USA ends on Nov 3. IS released the calendar in PST, which is still not in use, so all dates are off by one (except for GC, which starts 4 hours after the reset). You can see this by just comparing with the [Japanese calendar](https://twitter.com/FE_Heroes_JP/status/1182491007616552961). I think I fixed things, but...
    
*   Expect some errors from bugs, reward changes by IS, unlisted events, etc
    
*   I'll try to update this as datamines/twitter rewards/etc come out, but I might give up on the last few days since it involves too much futurology. We'll see.
