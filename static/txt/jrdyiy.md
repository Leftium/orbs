# Estimate of upcoming orbs based on the 2020-11 calendar

[](https://i.imgur.com/k59MHYd.png)

This list of orbs is based on the [most recent calendar](https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/img/topics/detail/img_20201110.png).

Notes:

*   The official calendar is in PST (UTC-8), which means that for most of the world the events will appear to start one day later. (Except for Grand Conquests, which starts 4 hours after the reset and so already "looks right")
    
*   I'm assuming you'll get 4 orbs at the end of Arena and Allegiance Battles. Adjust accordingly.
    
*   I'm guessing version 5.0.0 with Squad Assault 41 will be released on 2020-12-06, 2 days before a New Heroes banner.
    
*   I'm assuming Book V will start in December with the release of the first two chapters, just like Books II, III and IV. I'm also assuming Book V, Chapter 1 Part 5 will give a 5★ hero instead of 1 orb on Normal difficulty.
    
*   Previous Three Hero Quests gave 6 orbs, so I'm guessing that'll also happen on 2020-12-04.
    
*   I'm guessing Skill Studies 102 will arrive on 2020-11-27 with 1 orb, but they haven't been completely consistent lately.
    
*   [Looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/jo9672/datamine_grab_bag_20201105/gb7839k/) Pawns of Loki will distribute up to 6 orbs for your cumulative score. Also, on each round, we'll get up to 3 orbs based on our individual tier and 1 orb per round via quests. For this event I'm going to assume 1 orb for your tier; I'll probably change it to 2 for the next event. NB: there might _still_ be errors here; we'll know for sure when the mode launches.
    
*   The calendar has events starting up to 2020-12-09. The list below ends on 2020-12-14 to end the Arena week.
